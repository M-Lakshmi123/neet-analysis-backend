# NEET Analysis System - Startup Guide

We have switched to a robust **Manual Startup** method to avoid Windows permission issues.

### How to Start the System (After Restart)
1.  **Turn on your PC** and log in.
2.  Look for the file **`Start_NEET_System.bat`** on your Desktop.
3.  **Double-click it**.

### What Happens Next?
*   Two black windows will open briefly and then minimize (hide).
*   **Window 1:** Runs the Backend Server (Database Connection).
*   **Window 2:** Runs the Internet Tunnel (Public Link).
*   **Wait 1-2 Minutes:** The system needs this time to generate a secure public link and update the website.

### How to Access the Website
Once started, you can access the site from anywhere using this link:
**[https://medical-2025-srichaitanya.web.app/](https://medical-2025-srichaitanya.web.app/)**

### Troubleshooting
*   **"No Data Found":** If you see the website but no data, wait 30 seconds and refresh the page (`Ctrl + F5`). The connection might just be waking up.
*   **"Site Not Loading":** Ensure you double-clicked the `.bat` file on the desktop. If you did, wait a minute and try again.
